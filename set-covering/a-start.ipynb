    "A* is considered \"optimal\" because it guarantees finding the shortest path as long as the heuristic function h(n) is admissible (never overestimates the true cost) and consistent (satisfies the triangle inequality). Common heuristics include the Manhattan distance or Euclidean distance for grid-based and Euclidean spaces, respectively."
